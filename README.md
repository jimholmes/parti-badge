# Jim's #PartiBadge fork.
My fork of the #PartiBadge project from Particle. Read their project's readme for more betterer info about the overall project.

My fork is me playing around with a number of things:

* Learning how events work for pub/sub
* Refactoring the demo to make it more understandable for me. (Hey, I write demoware. I get it.)
* Fixed a couple code issues
* Learn how to accomplish goals on Particle's scavenger hunt

Initial work done at ThatConference 2018.
